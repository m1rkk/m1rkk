# 👋 Hi, I'm Mark Krustans!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student and an aspiring full-stack developer with big ambitions and a strong drive to learn everything needed to become a professional in the field.

💻 I currently work with technologies like Java, Spring Boot, Angular, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and both relational and NoSQL databases (SQL, MongoDB). I'm especially focused right now on mastering Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

🚀 As I grow, I'm expanding my skill set beyond just coding — soon I’ll be diving into tools like Docker and Kubernetes to better understand deployment and scalability in real-world applications.

📚 This GitHub is my personal space to document my journey, share projects, and continuously improve as a developer.
